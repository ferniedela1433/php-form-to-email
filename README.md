php-form-to-email
=================

Easy PHP Form to Email Script.

1. Create a form with action pointing to the emailer.php file, and method="get". See example below:
<pre>
	<form method="get" action="emailer.php">
	</form>
</pre>
2. Create as many input fields as you want, each with a 'name' tag. See example below:
<pre>
	<input name="Email" />
</pre>

3. Put a submit button on the form.

4. Modify the settings in settings.php (dumb-proof) and you're all set to go!
